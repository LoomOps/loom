# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.59

- Unify the Runtimes sidebar, tab and badges with a shared layered icon, distinct from Models and Docker.
- Use a shared multi-tool icon for Tools, distinct from Troubleshooting and terminal commands.

## 0.1.0-alpha.58

- Namespace installation smoke Components by build so post-upgrade acceptance does not collide with immutable earlier smoke registrations or reuse a previous build's execution receipt.

## 0.1.0-alpha.57

- Record the exact immutable kit build in fresh installation state so the first subsequent upgrade can locate the installed source safely.

## 0.1.0-alpha.56

- Correct fresh-install Gateway diagnostics mount validation while continuing to reject unrelated mounts, incorrect host paths and unusable diagnostics grants.

## 0.1.0-alpha.46

- Define one requested outcome per Job; batching and acceleration remain internal to the pinned runner by default.
- Add bounded producer-reported internal steps and explicit consolidation of completed producer Jobs without rewriting their history. Show the verified canonical Job by default with original execution history available.
- Add a durable operator dispatch pause that fences old workers, survives updates, permits staged continuation admission after update and resumes only with the matching pause key.
- Align server, Loom Use alpha.8 and external coordination guidance around logical Job boundaries and exact output reuse.

## 0.1.0-alpha.45

- Support validated administrator GPU driver capabilities, including graphics, and explicit none/bridge runtime networking without accepting Job Docker-policy overrides.
- Carry runtime options through fresh installation and verify actual grants; preserve executor configuration across update/resume/rollback.
- Add an opt-in bounded runtime doctor using the real broker, execution UID, mounts, read-only root, scratch and driver libraries. Keep runtime acceptance separate from scientific evaluation.
- Include the repository audit corrections and Extensions navigation prepared after alpha.43.


## Source audit included in alpha.45

- Align Extensions documentation across guides and feature specifications while preserving Component/Tool/Profile contracts and the six MCP groups.
- Accept matching sealed Profile source pins when explicitly copying legacy Components to Tools; reject conflicting evidence for Tool/Profile registration.
- Verify database file ownership/modes during state preservation and restore database attributes and symlink ownership on rollback.
- Harden client/guide archive paths and installed file-set checks; stop shared helpers before resuming an update. Correct the removed in-tree client installation reference.
- Enforce maintenance/readonly fencing for Component/Tool/Profile writes and ownership reassignment.
- This section records source review; actual deployment acceptance is recorded separately.

## 0.1.0-alpha.44

- Shorten the combined software navigation and page title to Extensions; retain Components and Tools as type filters.

## 0.1.0-alpha.43

- Combine Components and Tools in one searchable, type/namespace-filtered software inventory with a distinct sidebar icon.
- Add revision browsing, source hashes, execution stages and exact Profile/Tool usage links; preserve historical revision URLs and background-refresh selections.
- Improve light/dark and narrow/split-pane software layouts without browser registration or execution actions.

## 0.1.0-alpha.41

- Separate immutable research Tools from Job lifecycle Components; expose discovery, exact revision copying and pinned read-only execution through existing MCP groups and Dashboard.
- Ship cumulative dependency-ordered administrator migrations with bounded check/apply/verify scripts and durable receipts.
- Add explicit state-preserving container rebuild, private all-database/configuration snapshots, preservation checks and resumable/guarded recovery.
- Require effective storage parity at update/installation readiness, including old installs without a plan, actual mounts, executor and SSH grants, marker IDs, boot dependencies and service-user access.


## 0.1.0-alpha.40

- Apply normalized dataset facts to list rows and detail highlights, not only the Properties panel.
- Show compact input types and recorded splits; keep verbose producer summaries and input descriptions in the detail page.
- Keep fact labels intact while wrapping on narrow screens, with list-route browser regression coverage.

## 0.1.0-alpha.39

- Show consistent dataset properties from the normalized overview and load detailed source metadata on demand. Keep observation counts, missing values and original records distinct.
- Include active preserved catalog models and datasets in result discovery with exact historical detail references; do not imply payload availability or execution readiness.
- Restrict new Agent Token owners to current Admins and approved shared members, on both the Dashboard and issue API. Keep historical owner attribution and explicit token revocation intact.


## 0.1.0-alpha.38

- Preserve service ownership and private modes when atomically replacing the managed-access journal; distinguish local permission/storage errors from upstream failures.
- Collect private local diagnostics across Ops, Dashboard and Gateway with a 1 GiB default retention budget and configurable rotation. Preserve diagnostic correlation in standard MCP error content.
- Support compact group-only MCP action discovery and report current historical-artifact availability separately from preserved imported evidence.
- Pin Loom Use alpha.6 with installation write preflight, actionable refresh status and private client diagnostics.
- Extend packaging, permission, transport and cross-repository regressions without adding Job execution gates.

## 0.1.0-alpha.37

- Pin Loom Use alpha.5: honor explicit Tailscale authentication, verify identity on reconnect, preserve concurrent configuration changes during rollback, and validate MCP response envelopes.
- Stop creating retired agent-operation directories; clarify independent client ownership in installation and developer documentation.
- Validate component source path conflicts before publication and recover identical immutable snapshots after a rolled-back registration.
- Extend component, host-layout, client transport and cross-repository packaging regression coverage.

## 0.1.0-alpha.36

- Pin Loom Use alpha.4: resolve verified Codex socket symlinks, report specific refresh failures, and keep thread ID optional for current-chat verification only.
- Clarify that cwd is the existing invoking project context, not an automatically created or discovered project.

## 0.1.0-alpha.35

- Configure managed SSH after final storage registration and preserve its socket mount across restarts.
- Wait for initial service health; distinguish waiting and unrun smoke checks, and explain server sudo requirements early.
- Pin Loom Use alpha.3 with native WebSocket-over-Unix Codex reconnection and real framing regressions.
- Expose component/profile Owner metadata, explicit Built-in common components and shared discovery without moving revisions.

## 0.1.0-alpha.34

- Add Admin-managed personal host SSH accounts, exact Tailscale policy bindings and per-user MCP connection discovery.
- Keep local agents on local filesystem access; distribute optional Loom SSH with Loom Use alpha.2.
- Preserve homes and Jobs on SSH revocation; integrate protected helper lifecycle, storage ACLs, doctor and uninstall.
- Audit feature blocks against actual executed cases and tested source hashes; reject missing, skipped and stale evidence.
- Verify every Dashboard Docker COPY input against the staged release and build allowlist, including generated build metadata. Alpha.32–33 were unpublished verification candidates.

## 0.1.0-alpha.31

- Split client installation, connection profiles and the Skill into LoomOps/Loom-Use.
- Pin the exact tested client release in server guides and installer handoff.
- Delegate optional client setup to its INSTALL.md for the current agent/user.

## 0.1.0-alpha.28 — 2026-11-08

- Remove the retired browser token-entry fallback; missing native identity now stays closed with a retry action.

- Align installer defaults and documentation with Gateway 443 / private 8443; keep explicit existing ports.
- Remove obsolete local short-lived credential issuance; preserve existing expiry semantics.
- Support verified Tailscale guide refresh with principal-scoped caches and consistent private credential reads.
- Strip all client token rows on export and restore; reject schema-1 exports that would omit secondary-store payloads.
- Review all tracked files, feature verification boundaries, dev/alpha packaging and current instructions.

## 0.1.0-alpha.27 — 2026-11-08

- Fix sandbox-blocked token revocation with a parent-owned confirmation dialog.
- Remove duplicate connection instructions from token issuance; installer supplies exact private-endpoint setup commands.

## 0.1.0-alpha.26 — 2026-11-08

- Align Agent Token forms/dialogs with the Dashboard theme and collapse revoked history.
- Show verified development network identity without implying Admin rights.

## 0.1.0-alpha.25 — 2026-11-08

- Verify deployed native identity, private relay routes and separate public Gateway during update acceptance.
- Repair Admin, update-check and event relay routing.

## 0.1.0-alpha.24 — 2026-11-08

- Add Dashboard Admin-issued, individually revocable agent tokens without expiration.
  Resident clients retain their selected user identity and operational scopes.
- Add private token storage, Codex Streamable HTTP setup and read-only client doctor.
  Installation offers client setup without automatically issuing credentials.
- API revision: `loom-ops/v38`; six MCP groups and Job contracts remain unchanged.

## 0.1.0-alpha.23 — 2026-11-08

- Guide existing Tailscale connection reuse, initial login, explicit account switching
  and device approval separately from the Loom Admin email and management credential.
- Journal installation and runtime policy/tag ownership, reconcile uncertain writes,
  and restore only owned changes during uninstall. Preserve reused manual invitations
  and shared resources; detect final-device-tag reauthentication before stopping services.
- Add reviewed, policy-only cleanup for removed installations, plus installation
  doctor, offline-kit dependency and regression coverage.
- Include the ownership journal module in the explicit Dashboard build context.
  Alpha.22 failed packaging and was never published or deployed.

## 0.1.0-alpha.21 — 2026-11-08

- Add an administrator-only uninstall CLI that previews and removes an instance's
  managed Sharing grants/invitations, listeners and local access history. Remote
  cleanup is verified before deleting credentials; interrupted cleanup can resume.
  Jobs, artifacts, shared host dependencies and the host's Tailscale identity remain.

## 0.1.0-alpha.20 — 2026-11-08

- Expose artifact location repair as `results.reconnect` through MCP, generated
  reference/bundle and usage guides, matching the existing HTTP operation.
- Add HTTP/MCP parity and tokenless Tailscale MCP regression coverage; document
  instance-specific authentication and Sharing port reconciliation on upgrades.
- API revision: `loom-ops/v37`. Existing credentials, Job pins and data are preserved.

## 0.1.0-alpha.19 — 2026-11-08

- Default new installs to host /loom/data as data/0; prompt for optional RW stores and existing filesystem mounts. Preserve existing data owners and check effective service access.
- Add jobs.submit.output_storage, persistent storage identities, selected Attempt workspaces and result DB locations. Secondary outputs support catalog previews, result reconnects and hash-checked downstream input mounts. Existing Jobs retain their primary output storage.
- Expose store discovery and output selection through the same HTTP/MCP contracts; retain six tool groups. Show Output Storage in native Job properties.
- Offer Loom Use skill installation and user-scoped MCP registration after verified server installation. Client verification is separate from service readiness.
- Extend storage, executor, result, installer and client-handoff regressions; isolate release tests from installed host systemd units.

## 0.1.0-alpha.18 — 2026-11-08

- Pin the Docker bridge gateway to the exact trusted ingress address. Installation doctor compares live container gateways and trusted-proxy configuration, catching healthy services that cannot identify Tailscale users.
- Distinguish a failed private identity probe from a new visitor. Show connection/administrator guidance instead of prompting an existing user to request another invitation.
- Block duplicate Sharing invitations for native Admins/users, approved recipients and existing tailnet members. Membership lookup failures cannot fall through to sending an invitation.
- Ask explicitly for the Tailscale login email of the account that will administer Loom; update installation steps, diagnostics and operator guidance together.
- Refine Gateway acrylic: 34% tint in both themes, 30px card-only backdrop blur, 60px continuous corners and no white edge highlight. Preserve the scene blur and readable controls.
- Recheck all 15 feature boundaries, regression suites and matching installation/usage packaging. Existing installations retain local configuration and need an explicit idle repair if their bridge gateway differs.

## 0.1.0-alpha.17 — 2026-11-08

- Require the complete native Tailscale/Sharing installation: Ops, Dashboard, Gateway, executor and explicit Admin identity. Reject boolean Tailscale/token-only installation plans.
- Split installation guidance into seven steps, with host-based recommendations, per-step rereading and Gateway-first handoff.
- Add read-only stage diagnostics (`doctor`/`verify`) for actual identities, images, mounts, services, observations and public/private ingress. Progress receipts alone never establish readiness.
- Ship a repeatable CPU preparation/execution/result smoke Job and require its verified artifact before a successful handoff.
- Generate machine-bound plans, support additional read-only catalog storage, and grant only explicit native users the private machine port.
- Prepare the Python execution image explicitly and support packaging recovery from a verified immutable build. Source and offline kits include diagnostics and step documents.
- Review all 15 feature boundaries and extend installer, policy and result-contract regression coverage. Existing installations require scoped configuration reconciliation; this release does not automatically update services or rerun fresh installation.

## 0.1.0-alpha.16 — 2026-11-08

- Establish the public GPL-3.0-only source baseline, with license files in source, images and usage bundles.
- Keep one native Tailscale identity and machine Sharing flow. Remove the unused tailnet membership/device approval backend and obsolete login/admin UI.
- Remove personal operator references, one-off research migration/repair scripts, the old Agent application and pre-component producer execution.
- Expose only the six documented MCP groups. Preserve existing database identities, ownership, history and immutable artifacts.
- Keep GitHub Release discovery, explicit idle updates, local overrides and versioned usage guides; no automatic deployment is introduced.
- Extend regression coverage for unsupported routes, preserved historical data, distribution licensing and all-source syntax validation.
